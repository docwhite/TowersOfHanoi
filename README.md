Towers Of Hanoi
============

Puzzle solver. To use in Maya, written in Python.

##Installation
First of all, if you are not familiarized with git and you don't know how the cloning stuff works, just keep it simple:
Download all this project as a ZIP file (button on right side of the screen). Then, once you have extracted all the contents on your Desktop or wherever you want..
* Uncompress the ZIP file you just downloaded
* Open `startScript.py` with Notepad or your favourite text editor
* Copy all the content from it.
* Paste it to the Script Editor in Maya
* Execute the code
* You will be asked to point the location where all the scripts are. You must point to the folder called `script` inside the uncompressed  folder in which you have uncompressed the ZIP file.
* The UI should be created, then you can click on "Instructions" in order to get started as soon as possible.

This method for including the pointed folder as a sys.path for maya to access the files has been adapted from Jared Auty's wonderful scripting project, which you can download here  http://bit.ly/1kDUXhj

##Usage
Yet to be written.
